cmd_line_options
================

   See examples and Wiki at:  http://github.com/formiaczek/cmd_line_options/wiki


Command line options library is meant to provide an easy way for adding command-line options to your program. The idea is to allow creation and addition of options in the easiest possible way - with only minimal programming effort: few lines of code to extend your program to have cmd line options.


Note, that this project does not require additional libraries - just use your favourite C++ compiler
and include cmd_line_options.h file in your source. Boost build-system is used for development - but only for convenience (to build & test it easier etc.)
