cmd_line_options
================

   See Wiki at:  http://github.com/formiaczek/cmd_line_options/wiki
   
   
Note, that this project does not require additional libraries - just use your favourite C++ compiler
and includ cmd_line_options.h file in your source.

I have used boost build-system, thus Jamfile is present in project sources, but this is only for
convenience (to build & test it all at once etc.)
